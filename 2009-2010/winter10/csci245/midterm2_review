major themes: classes, pointers, memory

STL: map, vector, iterator



Classes: inheritence, overloading operators
memory: stack, heap, (copy constructors, assignment operators, destructors [interaction between classes and memory])

static variables have the same status as global variables

copying in and out

heap and stack; new and delete

"find the errors" questions
delete a;
delete[] a;
(differences between delete and delete[])

When are destructors called?
What is the difference between delete and delete[]?
What is the difference between virtual and nonvirtual methods?
What does inheritance mean?
What is slicing?
What is assigning?

A lot of plus or minus pointer questions.
Streams, recursion, sorting, searching... list queues stacks
memory management
